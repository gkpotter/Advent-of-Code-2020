# Advent of Code 2020
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an Advent calendar of programming puzzles. I solved each day's puzzles in [Python](https://www.python.org), since it is the language with which I am most familiar. I also solved each puzzle in either [Ocaml](https://ocaml.org), to satisfy my curiosity about this niche functional languae, or [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), to improve my familiarity with it.
