# Advent of Code 2020
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an Advent calendar of programming puzzles with an acompanying storyline that motivates the puzzles. I solved each day's puzzle in [Python](https://www.python.org), since it is the language with which I am most familiar. I also solved each puzzle in either [Ocaml](https://ocaml.org), to satisfy my curiosity about this niche functional language, or [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), to improve my familiarity with it.

The Python scripts are largely unchanged from what popped into my mind to solve the puzzle as quickly as I could. For the OCaml scripts, I refactored the solutions in a functional style. For the Node.js scripts, the translation was more straight forward, but I did refactor some of the solutions.

Below is a table recording which puzzles I solved with each language. Every day is broken into two parts with a star rewarded for solving each part (as per the storyline).
